        Intelligent Signals is the brainchild of Andrew Anthony (founder), a
        professional trader with over 20 years in forex, stocks, and crypto. A
        former analytical scientist, senior manager, and entrepreneur, he soon
        developed a passion for technical analysis using GANN techniques. He
        developed a manual system for chart pattern recognition that provides an
        accuracy of 70% profitability per trade. It was not long before he used
        the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning to automate
        the process. Intelligent Signals was formed.
